# Experience Driven and Performance Oriented Multipah Congestion Control (MPCC)

We have the following folders:

1.DDPG training and Comparison: It contains the Deep Dterministic Policy Gradient code which works on extracted data and create visualizations to observe its performance

2.MPCC Comparison: In this folder we compare the various MPTCP algorithms by visualizaing the data we get in various scenarios. It has the setup for the Cloudlab testbed to extract testing data for our observations

Researchers: Shiva Raj Pokhrel, Jonathan Kua and Deol Satish
